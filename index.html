My research focuses on developing efficient planning and decision-making algorithms for robotics and autonomous vehicles, with an emphasis on reinforcement learning, real-time control, and optimization. I aim to develop principled methods that integrate control theory and machine learning to enable intelligent decision-making in complex, dynamic environments.</p> <p>Before Berkeley, I earned a double major in Electrical and Electronics Engineering and Physics at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo%C4%9Fazi%C3%A7i_University" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Boğaziçi University</a>.</p> <p>Research Interests: Autonomous Driving &amp; Robotics Reinforcement Learning &amp; Optimal Control Machine Learning for Planning Real-time Control and Optimization</p> </body></html>
